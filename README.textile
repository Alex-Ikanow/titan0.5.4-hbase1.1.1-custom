Titan 0.5.4 with HBase 1.1.1 support


This is a 'one off' version of Titan 0.5.4 that provides support for
HBase 1.1.1 and Hadoop 2.7.1.

Because of changes in the underlying HBase and Hadoop code in the later versions,
this build includes minor code changes in the Titan-HBase shim classes to support
the latest versions of Hadoop and HBase in addition to the expected pom file changes
for dependencies.

Other than HBase and Hadoop version upgrades, this is the same Titan 0.5.4 that everyone
knows and loves.  I'll have to check on submitting this as a pull request to Titan 1.0
once that settles down - assuming the support for the later version of HBase and Hadoop
are not already supported.
